Tree Data Structure
    - Hierarchal data structure (Non-linear Data structure)
    - Components Of Tree
        -- leaf: The node that doesn't have branches
        -- Branch
        -- Root: Top most node from where tree starts
    - Binary Tree: special kind of three in which each node can possess only two branches.
-- Rule of PreOrder Traversal 
    -- Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Root
    - Left Subtree
    - Right Subtree
-- Rule of InOrder Traversal
    -- Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Left Subtree
    - Root
    - Right Subtree
-- Rule of PostOrder Traversal
    -- Time Complexity: O(n)
    - Left Subtree
    - Right Subtree
    - Root
-- Rule of Level Order Traversal
    -- One more data structure used Queue
    -- We will use Iteration;
    -- BFS: Breadth First Search (level Order)
    -- DFS: Death First Search (Other Traversal)
